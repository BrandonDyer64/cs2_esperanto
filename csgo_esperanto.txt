		"CSGO_Item_Desc_Elites"												"Firing two large-mag Berettas at once will lower accuracy and increase load times. On the bright side, you'll get to fire two large-mag Berettas at once."

		"CSGO_PickEm_Rules_Body"		"<b>Welcome to The Cologne 2014 Pick'Em Challenge!</b>\n\nYour goal is to score as many points as possible by correctly picking the winning teams as the tournament progresses. There are a total of 100 points to score and a Bronze, Silver, or Gold Pick'Em Challenge Trophy will be awarded for scoring 25, 50, or 75 points, respectively. Pick'Em Challenge Trophies are badges that are displayable on your CS:GO avatar and on your Steam profile. In addition to winning a trophy you can compete with your friends on the Pick'Em Friends Leaderboard.\n\nEach day of the event provides an opportunity to score 25 points: 24 for correct picks and 1 just for playing.\n\nTo make a pick during any stage of the tournament, you must own an unused sticker for the picked team. You can get stickers from ESL One Cologne 2014 Sticker capsules or from the Steam Community Market.\n\nA single team sticker is sufficient for picking that team multiple times throughout the event.\n\nUsing a team sticker to make a pick will lock the sticker for the day. It will not be usable or tradable until the next day. Undoing a pick will not unlock the sticker. It will still be unusable and untradable until the event day is complete. Once the event day is complete, locked stickers will unlock and be usable and tradable.\n\nDay 1 ( Aug 14th ) Pick the winner of each of eight group stage matches. Each correct pick is worth 3 points.\nDay 2 ( Aug 15th ) Pick the eight teams that will advance to the quarterfinals. Each correct pick is worth 3 points.\nDay 3 ( Aug 16th ) Pick the four teams that will advance to the semifinals. Each correct pick is worth 6 points.\nDay 4 ( Aug 17th ) Pick the two teams that will advance to the grand finals and the one team that will win the grand finals. Each correct pick is worth 8 points.\n\nOn each day you can earn an additional point just for playing.\n\nTrophies will be awarded after the tournament is complete."

		"SFUI_HowToPlay_IntroductionContents"			"<font size='24'>THE GAME MODES</font><br/>Counter-Strike has four basic game modes: Classic Casual, Classic Competitive, Arms Race, and Demolition. <br/><br/><font size='30'>CLASSIC</font><br/>The two Classic modes share the same basic rules. Games are played on either Hostage or Bomb maps.  In both types of maps, a single match is divided into multiple timed rounds.  Your team wins a round by eliminating all members of the opposing team or by completing map objectives. In Hostage maps, Counter-Terrorists try to locate hostages and carry them to an rescue zone.  Terrorists must prevent the hostages from being rescued.  For either team, harming hostages decreases your score and reduces the money available for purchasing weapons and equipment in the next round. In Bomb maps, the Terrorists try to plant and detonate a bomb at one of two bomb sites.  The Counter-Terrorists must prevent the bomb from being planted or defuse it once it is planted at a bomb site. <br/><br/>The two classic modes differ in four major ways. In competitive mode, Friendly Fire is on, Team Collision is on, you must purchase Armor and Defuse kits (you get them automatically in Casual), and matches last thirty rounds rather than ten.<br/><br/><font size='30'>ARMS RACE</font><br/> Arms Race takes place in a single round, and unlike the other three modes, dead players respawn instantly. Upon respawn, you're invulnerable for five seconds or until you attack. Weapons and equipment aren't purchasable in Arms Race. Instead, everyone starts with the same weapon, and you receive a new weapon for every enemy you kill. The final weapon you earn is a golden knife, and the first player to make a kill with the golden knife wins the game. <br/><br/><font size='30'>DEMOLITION</font><br/>Demolition mode is a fast-paced hybrid of the Classic and Arms Race game rules.  It consists of two multi-round matches.  At the end of the first match, the teams switch sides. A team wins a round by either eliminating the enemy team or by detonating or defusing the bomb.  Weapons and equipment are not purchasable. Instead, if you eliminate an enemy, you receive a new weapon at the beginning of the next round. You also earn bonus grenades for each additional kill you make beyond the first in a single round. The team with the most rounds won wins the match."

		"SFUI_HowToPlay_GettingStartedLabel"			"Getting Started"
		"SFUI_HowToPlay_GettingStartedContents"			"<font size='24'>CHOOSING A TEAM</font><br/>You can choose to play on either the Counter-Terrorist or Terrorist team as long as there is room for you to join. Choosing the 'Auto-Select' option assigns you to a team randomly.  Each team has different weapons available to it as well as different objectives. <br/><br/><font size='24'>SCORE</font><br/>You can view your individual score (and those of your teammates and opponents) on the scoreboard by pressing ${togglescores}.  Scoring events:<br/>6 points for defusing a bomb<br/>2 points for killing an enemy<br/>2 points for planting a bomb<br/>2 points for rescuing one hostage<br/>1 point for assisting with a kill<br/>-2 points for killing yourself<br/>-2 points for killing a hostage<br/>-2 points for killing a teammate<br/><br/><font size='24'>MY AWARDS</font><br/>Achievements, stats, awards and leaderboard rankings help you gauge your personal performance.  You must be signed into your Steam profile to earn achievements and awards, to save your stats, or to post to the leaderboards.<br/><br/><font size='24'>OFFLINE WITH BOTS</font><br/>Offline mode lets you explore the game at your own pace by competing with computer-controlled opponents. You can adjust the difficulty of Offline mode by setting the skill level of the bot opponents.<br/>"
		"SFUI_HowToPlay_ClassicLabel"					"Classic Rules"
		"SFUI_HowToPlay_ClassicContents"				"<font size='24'>WINNING</font><br/>A Classic match is made up of timed rounds. There are two ways to win a round: complete your team's map objective or eliminate all enemy players. The first team to win a majority of rounds wins the match.<br/><br/><font size='30'>BUYING GEAR</font><br/>You begin a match with some basic equipment and a set amount of money. Each round within a match starts in a Buy Zone where you have the opportunity to purchase equipment. The amount of time available to make purchases lasts 45 seconds; after that, there's no opportunity to buy equipment until the beginning of the next round.<br/><br/><font size='30'>EARNING MONEY</font><br/>Players earn money by killing enemies, achieving mission objectives, and winning rounds. Shooting teammates and hostages reduces your payout.<br/><br/><font size='30'>DYING AND SPECTATING</font><br/>There is no way to gain additional health. Once your health indicator reaches zero, you're dead until the next round starts. When you die, you lose all of the gear you have purchased. While dead and waiting for the next round to start, you can watch the game from the point of view of other players and take control of any of your team's bots.<br/><br/><font size='30'>RESCUING HOSTAGES</font><br/>If you're a Counter-Terrorist, your goal in Hostage maps is to extract hostages. To do this, move close to each hostage and press ${+use} to make them follow you, then lead them to a rescue zone. Rescue zones are marked with an H on the Mini Map. They're also identified by the hostage rescue zone icon <img src = 'hud_hostage_zone_icon.png' width='24' height='24'/> that appears in the upper left corner of the HUD when you're inside the zone. When all hostages have been escorted to a rescue zone then the Counter-Terrorists win the round. Either team can win by eliminating all members of the opposing team. If all hostages have been killed, the round can only be won through team elimination. Players on either team lose money and score for injuring or killing hostages.<br/><br/><font size='30'>PLANTING AND DEFUSING THE BOMB</font><br/>Bomb maps require the Terrorist team to plant and detonate a bomb. The Counter-Terrorist team must stop them. A randomly chosen Terrorist is assigned to carry the bomb. If you have the bomb, you will see the bomb carrier icon <img src = 'c4_inventory.png' width='24' height='24'/>in your HUD and on the scoreboard next to your name. Deliver it to either of two bomb sites and plant it. Bomb sites are labeled A and B. Signs scattered throughout the map will help you find the sites. A and B markers also appear in the Mini Map Radar. A flashing bomb icon <img src = 'hud_bombzone.png' width='24' height='24'/>appears on the HUD when you're at a bomb site. Press the Use ${+use} button to plant the bomb, and then prevent the Counter-Terrorists from defusing it. Counter-Terrorists win by eliminating all Terrorists or by defusing the bomb. To defuse a bomb, stand near it and hold ${+use} until you see a message saying that the bomb has been defused. If you have a Defuse Kit, you'll see the Defuse Kit icon <img src = 'hud_defuser.png' width='24' height='24'/> in your HUD and in the scoreboard next to your name. The Defuse Kit will speed up the defusing process, but is not required to defuse a bomb.<br/>"

		"SFUI_HowToPlay_Tactics"						"Tactics"
		"SFUI_HowToPlay_TacticsContents"				"<font size='24'>ACCURACY</font><br/>Like real weapons, Counter-Strike weapons recoil when they are fired. The longer a fully automatic weapon is fired, the more inaccurate it will become. It will return to its normal accuracy shortly after you stop firing. Moving while firing decreases your accuracy, and jumping reduces the accuracy even more.<br/><br/><font size='24'>WEAPON SWAPPING</font><br/>in the two Classic modes, dead players drop their weapons. To swap your weapon for one on the ground, aim at the dropped weapon and press ${+use}. Alternately, you can drop your current weapon by pressing ${drop} and then simply walk over the desired weapon.<br/><br/><font size='24'>HEADSHOTS</font><br/>Headshots do much more damage than shots to the body. You can often kill an enemy with one well-placed shot to the head.<br/><br/><font size='24'>BEING A TEAM PLAYER</font><br/>Teams that work well together as a unit win more.  When you are playing with other people, use headsets to communicate and coordinate with your team members.  Assign roles and duties.  You can monitor player status on the Scoreboard screen and the in-game mini-scoreboard.  Pay attention to the Notification Area in the upper right corner and the Mini Map in the upper left corner of your screen. The Notification Area will display a dead player's name and who killed them.  The Mini Map will briefly display where a teammate was killed.<br/><br/><font size='24'>LEARN THE MAPS</font><br/>Explore the maps offline against bots.  Get to know each map, and all of its routes and ambush spots. When playing against humans, take advantage of the Spectate mode to observe how other players navigate the maps.<br/><br/><font size='24'>USE YOUR GRENADES</font><br/>All types of grenades are useful.  HE grenades can flush out enemies.  Smoke grenades create cover from sniper fire. Flashbangs temporarily blind and deafen enemies, making it very difficult for them to accurately target you.  Molotov cocktails and Incendiary grenades can create a flaming barrier to entry or exit points.  Decoy grenades produce team specific noise to confuse your opponents, and even affect the enemy's Mini Map display.<br/><br/><font size='24'>KEEP MOVING</font><br/>Constant movement will make you a difficult target.  Movement while in crouch and walking states is useful when attempting to ambush an enemy or assuming a sniper role.<br/><br/><font size='24'>MIX UP YOUR TACTICS</font><br/>Do not go back to the well too often.  If you continue to follow your same course of action because it worked great once, assume that your earlier victims will catch on and be waiting for you to pull the same tactic the next round.<br/><br/><font size='24'>OBJECTIVE UNDER GUARD</font><br/>When defusing or planting the bomb or approaching the hostages, check to make sure an enemy isn't waiting nearby to ambush you.<br/><br/><font size='24'>RELOAD OFTEN</font><br/>Reload often.  If you run out of ammo in the middle of a firefight, switch to your other weapons instead of trying to reload exposed and under fire.<br/><br/><font size='24'>STEALTH</font><br/>Stealth is vitally important in Counter-Strike. When a player runs, their footsteps can be heard. To prevent this, switch to walk mode by pressing ${+speed} when trying to avoid detection. Also be wary of doors and ladders. These will often emit a sound that may give your position away.<br/><br/><font size='30'>STAY ALIVE</font><br/>Running into a firefight guns blazing will generally get you killed. Savvy players will take cover as often as possible, and use their surroundings to their advantage. Work with your teammates to defeat the enemy.<br/>"

		"SFUI_Hint_Flashbang_Turn"		"Turning your view away from a Flashbang Grenade will lessen its blinding effects."
		"SFUI_Hint_Fire_Makes_Slow"		"Use molotovs and incendiary grenades to cover the ground with fire and slow enemy rushes."
